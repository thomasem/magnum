Magnum Troubleshooting Guide
============================

This guide is intended for users who use Magnum to deploy and manage
clusters of hosts for a Container Orchestration Engine.  It describes
common failure conditions and techniques for troubleshooting.  To help
the users quickly identify the relevant information, the guide is
organized as a list of failure symptoms: each has some suggestions
with pointers to the details for troubleshooting.

A separate section `for developers`_ describes useful techniques such as
debugging unit tests and gate tests.

Failure symptoms
================

My bay-create takes a really long time
  If you are using devstack on a small VM, bay-create will take a long
  time and may eventually fail because of insufficient resources.
  Another possible reason is that a process on one of the nodes is hung
  and heat is still waiting on the signal.  In this case, it will eventually
  fail with a timeout, but since heat has a long default timeout, you can
  look at the `heat stacks`_ and check the WaitConditionHandle resources.

Kubernetes bay-create fails
  Check the `heat stacks`_, log into the master nodes and check the
  `Kubernetes services`_ and `etcd service`_.

Swarm bay-create fails
  Check the `heat stacks`_, log into the master nodes and check the `Swarm
  services`_ and `etcd service`_.

Mesos bay-create fails
  Check the `heat stacks`_, log into the master nodes and check the `Mesos
  services`_.

I get the error "Timed out waiting for a reply" when deploying a pod
  Verify the `Kubernetes services`_ and `etcd service`_ are running on the
  master nodes.

I deploy pods on Kubernetes bay but the status stays "Pending"
  The pod status is "Pending" while the Docker image is being downloaded,
  so if the status does not change for a long time, log into the minion
  node and check for `Cluster internet access`_.

Swarm bay is created successfully but I cannot deploy containers
  Check the `Swarm services`_ and `etcd service`_ on the master nodes.

Mesos bay is created successfully but I cannot deploy containers on Marathon
  Check the `Mesos services`_ on the master node.

I get a "Protocol violation" error when deploying a container
  For Kubernetes, check the `Kubernetes services`_ to verify that
  kube-apiserver is running to accept the request.
  Check `TLS`_ and `Barbican service`_.

My bay-create fails with a resource error on docker_volume
  Check for available volume space on Cinder and the `request volume
  size`_ in the heat template.
  Run "nova volume-list" to check the volume status.

Troubleshooting details
=======================

Heat stacks
-----------
*To be filled in*

A bay is deployed by a set of heat stacks:  one top level stack and several
nested stack.  The stack names are prefixed with the bay name and the nested
stack names contain descriptive internal names like *kube_masters*,
*kube_minions*.

To list the status of all the stacks for a bay:

    heat stack-list -n | grep *bay-name*

If the bay has failed, then one or more of the heat stacks would have failed.
From the stack list above, look for the stacks that failed, then
look for the particular resource(s) that failed in the failed stack by:

    heat resource-list *failed-stack-name* | grep "FAILED"

The resource_type of the failed resource should point to the OpenStack
service, e.g. OS::Cinder::Volume.  Check for more details on the failure by:

    heat resource-show *failed-stack-name* *failed-resource-name*

The resource_status_reason may give an indication on the failure, although
in some cases it may only say "Unknown".

If the failed resource is OS::Heat::WaitConditionHandle, this indicates that
one of the services that are being started on the node is hung.  Log into the
node where the failure occurred and check the respective `Kubernetes
services`_, `Swarm services`_ or `Mesos services`_.  If the failure is in
other scripts, look for them as `Heat software resource scripts`_.

Troubleshooting in Gate
-----------------------

Simulating gate tests
  *Note*: This is adapted from Devstack Gate's `README`_ which
  is worth a quick read to better understand the following)

  #. Boot a VM like described in the Devstack Gate's `README`_ .
  #. Provision this VM like so::

      apt-get update \
      && apt-get upgrade -y \ # Kernel upgrade, as recommended by README, select to keep existing grub config
      && apt-get install -y git tmux vim \
      && git clone https://git.openstack.org/openstack-infra/system-config \
      && system-config/install_puppet.sh && system-config/install_modules.sh \
      && puppet apply \
      --modulepath=/root/system-config/modules:/etc/puppet/modules \
      -e "class { openstack_project::single_use_slave: install_users => false,
      ssh_key => \"$( cat .ssh/authorized_keys | awk '{print $2}' )\" }" \
      && echo "jenkins ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL" >> /etc/sudoers \
      && cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys >> /home/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys
  #. Compare ``~/.ssh/authorized_keys`` and ``/home/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys``.  Your original public SSH key should now be in ``/home/jenkins/.ssh/authorized_keys``.  If it's not, explicitly copy it (this can happen if you spin up a using ``--key-name <name>``, for example).
  #. Assuming all is well up to this point, now it's time to ``reboot`` into the latest kernel
  #. Once you're done booting into the new kernel, log back in as ``jenkins`` user to continue with setting up the simulation.
  #. Now it's time to set up the workspace::

      export REPO_URL=https://git.openstack.org
      export WORKSPACE=/home/jenkins/workspace/testing
      export ZUUL_URL=/home/jenkins/workspace-cache2
      export ZUUL_REF=HEAD
      export ZUUL_BRANCH=master
      export ZUUL_PROJECT=openstack/magnum
      mkdir -p $WORKSPACE
      git clone $REPO_URL/$ZUUL_PROJECT $ZUUL_URL/$ZUUL_PROJECT \
      && cd $ZUUL_URL/$ZUUL_PROJECT \
      && git checkout remotes/origin/$ZUUL_BRANCH
  #. At this point, you may be wanting to test a specific change. If so, you can pull down the changes in ``$ZUUL_URL/$ZUUL_PROJECT`` directory::

      cd $ZUUL_URL/$ZUUL_PROJECT \
      && git fetch https://review.openstack.org/openstack/magnum refs/changes/83/247083/12 && git checkout FETCH_HEAD
  #. Now you're ready to pull down the ``devstack-gate`` scripts that will let you run the gate job on your own VM::

      cd $WORKSPACE \
      && git clone --depth 1 $REPO_URL/openstack-infra/devstack-gate
  #. And now you can kick off the job using the following script (the ``devstack-gate`` documentation suggests just copying from the job which can be found in the `project-config <https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config>`_ repository), naturally it should be executable (``chmod u+x <filename>``)::

      #!/bin/bash -xe

        - name: openstack-infra/devstack-gate

          ./magnum/tests/contrib/gate_hook.sh api # change this to swarm to run swarm functional tests or k8s to run kubernetes functional tests
      }
      export -f gate_hook
      function post_test_hook {

          cd /opt/stack/new/magnum/

Helpful nuances about the Devstack Gate
  * Main job is in ``project-config``'s `magnum.yaml <https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config/blob/master/jenkins/jobs/magnum.yaml>`_.

    * Must modify parameters passed in since those are escaped:

      * Anything with ``{}`` should be set as an environment variable

      * Anything with ``{{ }}`` should have those brackets changed to
        single brackets - ``{}``.

      * As with the documentation for Devstack Gate, you can just create
        a new file for the job you want, paste in what you want, then
        ``chmod u+x <filename>`` and run it.

    * Parameters can be found `here <https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config/blob/master/jenkins/jobs/projects.yaml#L2477-L2506>`_.

  * Three jobs are usually run as a part of Magnum gate, all of with are found in ``project-config``'s `macros.yml <https://github.com/openstack-infra/project-config/blob/master/jenkins/jobs/macros.yaml>`_:

    * link-logs

    * net-info

    * devstack-checkout

  * After you run a job, it's ideal to clean up and start over with a
    fresh VM to best simulate the Devstack Gate environment.
